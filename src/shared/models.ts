/**
 * Model capability profiles — the heart of the "model-aware" design.
 *
 * Each ATEM model declares what it can do. The editor UI shows only the tabs
 * and options a model supports, and the XML generator only emits the sections a
 * model has. Adding a new model is a single new entry in {@link MODEL_PROFILES}.
 *
 * Phase 1 ships two profiles spanning the two hardware classes in the fleet:
 *  - a Mini-class device (streaming, recording, ISO, UVC out) and
 *  - a big-switcher (SuperSource, multi-M/E, HyperDeck) matching the real
 *    autosave XML the generator is validated against.
 *
 * THIS CATALOG MUST STAY AUTHORITATIVE FOR BOTH OUTPUT PATHS. Three things
 * read a ModelProfile: the editor UI (which tabs and options to show),
 * xmlGenerator (which sections to emit) and buildApplySteps (which live
 * setters to run). Adding a model or a field in one consumer instead of here
 * makes the generated XML and the applied settings diverge for the same
 * declared configuration — and nothing in either path would notice.
 *
 * Note also that the XML path can express MORE than the live path can apply:
 * UVC routing, recording quality and media-pool contents are not settable over
 * the Ethernet protocol, and are reported as folder-export-only steps rather
 * than silently skipped. Keep that distinction explicit rather than implying
 * the two paths are equivalent.
